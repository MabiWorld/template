# Mabinogi World Wiki - Template Tool #
This is a tool that attempts to make the task of editing MWW data templates simpler.

It allows you to load data from the wiki by either typing the name of the item or by pasting the existing data template. You may also paste a totally innocuous XML format which it will parse into the form for you.

Currently it only supports weapons and to some extent equipment.

The running tool is at http://mabi.world/template/
